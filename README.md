# saga
A game I would enjoy playing

TODOs:
1. Entities should switch the direction they face before they move not after
2. Fix function and or property naming in Statistics
3. I represent and reference textures in several slightly different ways, I wonder which method is the best. What would it mean to cache them? `SelectionType` can reference them by its value that seems fairly useful.
4. Generalize InterfaceElements to nest as deep as I want. Probably not necessary but who cares
5. Make fill actions undoable
6. Add new file dialogue to name new images
7. Need to distinguish different types of moves, eg. walked pushed teleported etc
8. Figure out what happens when an entity dies
